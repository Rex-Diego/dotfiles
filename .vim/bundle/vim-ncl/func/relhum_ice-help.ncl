relhum_ice

   Calculates relative humidity with respect to ice, given temperature, mixing ratio, and pressure.

   [new.gif] Available in version 6.3.1 and later.

Prototype

        function relhum_ice (
                t  : numeric,
                w  : numeric,
                p  : numeric
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(t)] :  numeric

Arguments

   t

   A scalar or multi-dimensional array containing the temperature in K.
   w

   A scalar or multi-dimensional array containing the mixing ratio in kg/kg. Must be the same size and shape as t.
   p

   A scalar or multi-dimensional array equal to the pressure in hPa. Must be the same size and shape as t.

Return value

   A multi-dimensional array of the same sizes as t. The output will be double if any of the input is double, and float
   otherwise.

   The return missing value, if any, will be the default missing value for the type being returned.

Description

   Calculates relative humidity with respect to ice, given temperature, mixing ratio, and pressure.

Examples

   Example 1

  p  =  100.            ; hPa
  t  =   18.+273.15     ; C    ==> K
  q  =    6./1000.      ; g/kg ==> kg/kg

  rh = relhum_ice (t, q, p)
