time_reassign_cv2var

   Reassign (replace) a Cf-conforming "time" coordinate variable associated with a variable by calculating the mid-time
   values using the "bounds" attribute.

   [new.gif] Available in version 6.3.1 and later.

Prototype

load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"

        function time_reassign_cv2var (
                f            ,
                timeName [1] : string,
                varName  [1] : string
        )

        return_val [dimsizes(varName)]

Arguments

   f

   A variable of type 'file' or 'list'. The file(s) must be CF-concorming.
   timeName

   A string specifying the name of the time variable on the file(s). Most commonly the name is "time". This must a
   CF-conforming variable with units such as "seconds/minutes/hours/days since ...". It must have a bounds attribute. If not
   the original time will be returned. A string specifying the name of the variable.

Return value

   An array of the same size and type as the variable specified by varName.

Description

   Some models output a 'time' (timeName) that is not consistent with the date(s) indicated within the file name. Consider a
   model file named (say) FOO.2012-01.nc. This contains monthly averages for January 2012. However, the 'time' variable
   points to February 2012. Specifically,

     f    = addfile("FOO.2012-01.nc","r")     ; 'f' is type 'file'
     time = f->time                           ; "days since 2011-01-01 00:00:00"
     date = cd_calendar(time, 0)             ; (/ 2012,2, 1, 0, 0, 0 /)


   Note that the month is 'off-by-one'. It indicates February 2012 rather than January 2012. The reason is that the model
   accumulates statistcs until the time switches months (here from January to February). Unfortunately, the statistic (eg,
   monthly mean) is 'tagged' with the current model time (February) and not the previous month (January). Actually, the time
   'should be' the center-of-times of the previous month (eg, January 16).

   To address this issue, the CF conforming bounds attribute associated with the specified timeName variable is used to
   access the temporal bounds used to calculate the mean. These boundary times are averaged.

     time = f->time                        ; timeName => "time"
     if (isatt(time,"bounds")) then        ; CF attribute
         tbnd = f->time@bounds             ; (ntim,2)
         time = (tbnd(:,0)+tbnd(:,1))*0.5  ; center of 'time' bounds
     end if
     date = cd_calendar(time, 0)          ; (/ 2012, 1,16,12, 0, 0 /)


   Using the correct times can be particulary important when doing (say) compositing.

Examples

   Example 1

   This CAM file has monthly means from 1850-01 to 2005-12. Perform two tasks: (a) reassign (replace) the "time" values with
   the temporal monthly time means; (b) reassign (replace) the coordinate variable (cv) associated with the specified
   variable.

     dir    = "./"
     fil    = "b40.20th.track1.2deg.001.cam2.h0.PSL.1850-01_cat_2005-12.nc"
     f      = addfile(dir+fil, "r")

     time   = time_reassign(f, "time")                 ; 'new' time
     printVarSummary(time)

     psl    = time_reassign_cv2var(f, "time", "PSL")   ; 'new' time coordinate variable (cv)
     printVarSummary(psl)

   The (edited) output from the above would be:

   If the original and reassigned yyyy/mm/dd/hh were printed, you would readily see the more appropriate dates.
